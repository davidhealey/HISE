# HISE Contributor Agent Guide

> **MCP Users:** If the HISE MCP server is available, use the `contribute` prompt instead of reading this document manually. The prompt embeds the critical assessment sections and guides you through the workflow step by step. This document is available as a resource via `get_resource('contributor-agent-guide')` for reference during the workflow.

This document is for AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) assisting community contributors with HISE bugfixes and improvements. It supplements the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repository root. Read that document first for the overall workflow.

## Your Role

You are helping someone who is proficient with HISEScript but may have limited C++ experience. They can:
- Build HISE from source and run it in a debugger
- Reproduce bugs and inspect runtime state
- Navigate the HISE IDE and test changes

You can:
- Navigate and search the C++ codebase efficiently
- Assess the risk profile of a proposed change
- Identify established patterns and verify consistency
- Generate the Risk Assessment Checklist for the PR description

You cannot:
- Build or run HISE (the contributor does this)
- Observe runtime behavior (ask the contributor for debugger output)
- Make design decisions about HISE's architecture (escalate these)

## Risk Assessment Protocol

Before proposing or reviewing a fix, run through these checks systematically.

### 1. The Evidence Test

Search the codebase for structural evidence that the fix is correct:

- **Find sibling functions.** If you're modifying function X, read every other function in the same class. Do they do the thing you're adding? If yes, your fix is filling a gap in an established pattern.
- **Find the adjacent code.** If you're adding a property, find other properties in the same enum/registration block. Do they follow the same pattern? If yes, replicate it exactly.
- **Find consumers.** Search for all code that calls the function you're modifying, or reads the value you're changing. Can you enumerate every consumer and verify they won't be affected?

**If you can point to existing code that already does what the fix does** — cite it explicitly in the risk report. This is the strongest possible evidence for correctness.

**If you cannot find a precedent** and your justification relies on reasoning about what the behavior *should* be — flag this clearly. The contributor should escalate to the maintainer for design input.

### 2. The Consumer Trace (Grep Test)

Before proposing a change, search for everything that depends on the behavior you're modifying:

```
Search for: function name, enum value, property name, class name
In: the entire codebase (not just the file you're editing)
```

Ask yourself:
- Who calls this function?
- Who reads this value?
- Who serializes/deserializes this data?
- Is this accessed via integer indices that could shift?

If you cannot exhaustively trace all consumers, note this in the risk report. Untraced consumers are a risk signal.

### 3. Red Flags — Always Escalate

Stop and recommend the contributor escalate to the maintainer if the change involves ANY of these:

**Parameter/attribute indices:**
- Adding entries to a module's attribute enum before existing entries
- Changing the stride or offset of parameter indexing schemes
- Any modification to `getNumAttributes()`, `getAttribute()`, or `setInternalAttribute()` indexing logic

**Backend/frontend boundary:**
- Code guarded by `#if USE_BACKEND` or `#if USE_FRONTEND`
- File path resolution (paths work differently in exported plugins — files are embedded, not loaded from disk)
- The include system, `{GLOBAL_SCRIPT_FOLDER}` wildcards, `{BEGIN}/{END}` markers
- `getExternalScriptFromCollection()` (frontend script loading uses exact string matching)
- Any code path that differs between IDE and exported plugin

**Scripting engine internals:**
- The parser (`JavascriptEngineParser.cpp`)
- The preprocessor (`preprocessCode`, `resolveIncludeStatements`)
- Script compilation pipeline
- Expression evaluation (`ApiCall::perform`)

**Serialization format:**
- `exportAsValueTree` / `restoreFromValueTree` — existing presets and projects depend on stable serialization
- `toDynamicObject` / `fromDynamicObject` on floating tiles

**DSP and audio thread:**
- Changes to `renderNextBlock`, `processBlock`, `calculateBlock`, or any audio callback
- Adding objects that get instantiated per-voice or per-module-instance (modulation chains, child processors, buffers)
- Any code that could run on the audio thread — check for `ScopedLock` on the main controller lock as a hint

**Established behavior:**
- Changing how existing callbacks fire (control callbacks, timer callbacks, MIDI callbacks)
- Changing established DSP behavior (filter curves, envelope shapes, gain staging)
- Changing regex patterns or match criteria in parsers (broadening a regex can have unintended matches)

### 4. Positive Signals — Likely Safe

These patterns indicate a change is likely contributor-fixable:

**Pure additions (+N/-0 diffs):**
- No existing code is modified, only new code is inserted
- Existing code paths are completely untouched

**Pattern consistency:**
- The fix replicates what sibling functions already do
- LAF property forwarding (adding `setProperty` calls that match adjacent ones)
- API wrapper registration (`API_METHOD_WRAPPER`, `ADD_API_METHOD` following the established pattern)
- Floating tile property registration (`RETURN_DEFAULT_PROPERTY_ID`, `RETURN_DEFAULT_PROPERTY`, `storePropertyInObject`, `getPropertyWithDefault`)

**UI-layer only:**
- Changes confined to `hi_components/`, editor subdirectories
- Floating tile property additions
- No impact on DSP, scripting engine, or serialization

**Defensive guards:**
- Adding null checks, bounds checks, file-existence checks
- Adding early returns that prevent crashes without changing normal behavior

**HISE IDE (backend-only) UI changes:**
- Fixes to editor components, property panels, module tree views
- Adding keyboard shortcuts for existing functionality
- Layout or visual glitch fixes in backend-only panels
- Verify the code is guarded by `#if USE_BACKEND` or lives in `hi_backend/` — these changes cannot affect exported plugins

**Opt-in features:**
- New behavior that only activates when explicitly enabled via a new API call or property
- Default state preserves existing behavior exactly

## Debugger-Assisted Workflow

You cannot run HISE, but the contributor can. Use this workflow for crash bugs and behavioral issues where the root cause isn't obvious from reading the code:

### Step 1: Ask for reproduction

Ask the contributor to:
1. Build HISE in Debug configuration
2. Reproduce the bug
3. For crashes: capture the full call stack and inspect local variables at the crash site
4. For behavioral bugs: set breakpoints at suspected locations and report what values they see

### Step 2: Trace the root cause

With the runtime context from the contributor:
- Trace the call stack through the codebase to understand the chain of events
- Identify WHY a value is null/wrong/unexpected, not just WHERE it crashes
- Check whether the issue is a missing initialization, a wrong code path, or an architectural problem

### Step 3: Assess the fix

- **Simple root cause** (null pointer, missing guard, off-by-one): Propose the fix and verify it follows established patterns
- **Complex root cause** (lifecycle ordering, cross-module state, build-config divergence): Report your findings and recommend the contributor file them in the issue for the maintainer

### Critical: Don't Guess at Runtime Behavior

Without debugger output, AI tools tend to propose "symptom fixes" — changes that make the obvious error go away without addressing why it happens. Common traps:

- Adding a type check or guard that prevents the wrong code path from running, when the real issue is that the right code path isn't being reached
- Gating behavior on a condition that correlates with the bug but isn't the actual cause
- Fixing the crash site when the real bug is in the caller three levels up

If you're unsure about runtime state, **ask the contributor to verify** rather than guessing. A few minutes with the debugger is worth more than hours of code archaeology.

## Generating the Risk Report

Fill this out for the contributor to include in their PR description:

```markdown
### Risk Assessment

**Change type:**
- [ ] Bugfix (fixing obviously broken behavior)

- [ ] Feature addition (modifies existing behavior)

**Evidence:**
- [ ] I can link to existing code that already does what my fix does: [link/reference]
- [ ] This is a new pattern (no existing precedent in the codebase)

**Impact check:**
- [ ] Modifies DSP or audio rendering code

- [ ] Tested in Release build
- [ ] Tested in exported plugin (if applicable)
- [ ] Reproduced the original bug before applying fix

**Files changed:** [number] files, [additions/deletions] lines
```

### How to assess each impact item

- **DSP/audio rendering:** Search for the function name in audio callbacks (`renderNextBlock`, `processBlock`, `calculateBlock`). Check if the file is in `hi_dsp/`, `hi_modules/effects/`, `hi_modules/modulators/`, `hi_modules/synthesisers/`.
- **Parameter indices:** Check if the file contains attribute enums, `getAttribute`/`setInternalAttribute`, `getNumAttributes`. Search for integer constants used to index this module's parameters.
- **Serialization:** Search for `exportAsValueTree`, `restoreFromValueTree`, `toDynamicObject`, `fromDynamicObject` in the same class.
- **Backend/frontend guards:** Search for `USE_BACKEND`, `USE_FRONTEND`, `HI_EXPORT_AS_PROJECT_DLL` in the file.
- **Scripting engine:** Check if the file is in `hi_scripting/scripting/engine/`.
- **Per-instance objects:** Search for `PolyData`, `ModulatorChain`, `ChildProcessor` in the class definition.
- **Existing behavior:** Search for scripts or code that calls the function/method being changed. Check the HISE documentation for the current documented behavior.
- **Performance:** Check if the module being modified could be instantiated many times (e.g., `SineSynth` for additive synthesis, filters in modulation chains). Adding overhead to such modules affects all existing users.

## Architectural Quick Reference

### Backend vs Frontend vs DLL

| Build Target | `USE_BACKEND` | `USE_FRONTEND` | What it is |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| HISE IDE | 1 | 0 | Full development environment |
| Exported Plugin | 0 | 1 | What end users run |
| Project DLL | 0 | 0 | Custom C++ DSP loaded by IDE |

Key differences that catch contributors off guard:
- **Script files:** In backend, loaded from disk. In frontend, embedded in binary — retrieved by exact filename string match via `getExternalScriptFromCollection()`.
- **File paths:** In backend, real filesystem paths. In frontend, virtual paths and wildcards. `{GLOBAL_SCRIPT_FOLDER}`, `{PROJECT_FOLDER}`, etc. don't point to real directories.
- **Debug output:** `Console.print`, `debugToConsole`, etc. are stripped in frontend builds.
- **Editors:** All editor/debug UI code is `USE_BACKEND` only.

### Module Parameter Indexing

HISE modules expose parameters via integer indices. Scripts access them as `module.setAttribute(index, value)`. These indices are determined by enum order and are NOT stable across code changes — adding a new enum entry before existing ones shifts every index after it. DAW automation, presets, and scripts all depend on stable indices.

Some modules (like `CurveEq`) use computed indices: `filterIndex * numBandParameters + parameterType`. Inserting a global parameter before the per-band parameters shifts every band's indices.

**Rule: Never insert enum entries before existing entries. Append only, or use a separate mechanism (floating tile properties, runtime API calls) that doesn't affect the index scheme.**

### Threading

HISE uses a lock-free audio architecture. The audio thread must never block — no locks, no allocations, no I/O. The `KillStateHandler` coordinates safe cross-thread operations by suspending audio processing rather than blocking.

If your change modifies data that could be accessed from the audio thread, use `killVoicesAndCall()` to ensure safe modification. Look for `ScopedLock sl(getMainController()->getLock())` as an indicator that code is audio-thread-adjacent.

### Directory Risk Map

| Directory | Risk Level | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `hi_components/`, `*/editors/` | Lower | UI code, no audio impact |
| `hi_tools/hi_markdown/`, `hi_tools/simple_css/` | Lower | Rendering/styling, evolving features |
| `hi_tools/mcl_editor/` | Lower | Code editor component |
| `hi_core/hi_modules/effects/fx/` | Moderate | Effect implementations — established DSP |
| `hi_core/hi_modules/modulators/mods/` | Moderate | Modulator implementations |
| `hi_scripting/scripting/api/` | Moderate-High | Scripting API surface — changes affect all scripts |
| `hi_scripting/scripting/engine/` | High | Scripting engine internals |
| `hi_core/hi_dsp/modules/` | High | Base classes for all DSP modules |
| `hi_streaming/` | High | Audio streaming, time stretching |
| `hi_core/hi_core/` (`MainController`, `KillStateHandler`, `LockHelpers`) | Critical | Core infrastructure |

Note: HISE uses a custom JUCE fork. Files under `JUCE/` should be assessed by the same criteria as any other HISE code — judge risk by what the code does (networking, audio, UI), not by which directory it lives in.

## Common Fix Patterns

### Adding a floating tile property

1. Add entry to `SpecialProperties` enum (at the end, before `numSpecialProperties`)
2. Add `RETURN_DEFAULT_PROPERTY_ID` line (follow the pattern of adjacent entries)
3. Add `RETURN_DEFAULT_PROPERTY` line with default value
4. Add `storePropertyInObject` in `toDynamicObject`
5. Add `getPropertyWithDefault` in `fromDynamicObject` and apply the value

### Adding a scripting API wrapper

1. Add `API_METHOD_WRAPPER_N` or `API_VOID_METHOD_WRAPPER_N` in the Wrapper struct
2. Add `ADD_API_METHOD_N` in the constructor
3. Declare the method in the header with a `/** doc comment */`
4. Implement the method in the .cpp file

### Adding LAF property forwarding

1. Find the LAF function (usually in `ScriptingGraphics.cpp`)
2. Find the `setProperty` calls for the draw callback object
3. Add the missing property using the same `setProperty` / `setColourOrBlack` pattern
4. The property value is typically available from the component or its parent — check what's in scope

### Fixing a missing persistence call

1. Find where the setting is changed at runtime
2. Find the class that manages persistence (e.g., `GlobalSettingManager`)
3. Find the save method (e.g., `saveSettingsAsXml()`)
4. Add the persistence call after the runtime state change
5. Check: is there a matching load path? Does `restoreFromValueTree` / `fromDynamicObject` read this value?

### Fixing a null pointer crash

1. **Ask the contributor for the stack trace** — don't guess
2. Find why the pointer is null (missing initialization? wrong lifecycle order? component not in expected container?)
3. If the fix is a simple guard (null check + early return), verify the null case is truly exceptional and won't silently swallow important errors
4. If the fix requires understanding WHY the pointer should have been set, escalate — the null may be a symptom of a deeper issue
